# BIRDpy
BIRDpy  aims to be able to produce Tissue  models that integrate Bioelectricity and Reaction-Difussion Dynamics as a restriction for known COBRA methods of metabolic reconstruction.
The way BIRDpy achieves this feature is by becoming the medium for   COBRApy and BETSE integration.
BIRDpy sends information of current bioelectric states per cell to the model currently being modeled for metabolic reconstruction of unsteady state fluxes .
The textbook example simulation is a biofilm of bacillus subtilis that will reproduce experimental data  reported in the literature
BIRDpy is a personal project of Nini Ortiz 
BIRDpy does not claim ownership of BETSE or COBRApy or any known COBRA method
The materials that will be worked on in this repository are OPEN acces and not intended for commercial use of any kind


#Features  that will be unique to BIRDpy
REDOX non linear dynamics affects bioelectricity
Fractar analysis of bioelectric currents
Demixed PCA for the identification of the most important cells that coordinate the bioelectric respones/metabolic response
Lots of tears and blood  and broken dreams
